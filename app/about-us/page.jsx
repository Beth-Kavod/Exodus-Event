          Established in 2014 as a non-profit organization, the Cultural Arts
          Committee of Nogales, Arizona, has been busy creating events that
          bring the community together. We've hosted all sorts of things, from
          concerts and mariachi festivals to art workshops for kids and nativity
          exhibitions. In collaboration with the City of Nogales and the
          Consulate of Mexico, our programs cover a wide range, including
          scholarship initiatives, talks for Women's Week, and even a binational
          marathon. What makes it all happen? Our dedicated team of volunteers.
          The Board of Directors, made up of community members, including the
          former Consul General of Mexico, and local business leaders, helps
          steer the ship. We're all about supporting and celebrating our
          community.
